# <Tech Blog Website>

## Description

As someone who is interested in technology, and engaging in discourse about technology with others, I wanted to create a blog site.
Now, I can share my opinions with others, and interact with like-minded individuals about a topic I am passionate about!

In building this blog, I was able to explore the ins-and-outs of building an MVC application, and learned a ton in doing so. 
Also, my fundamental understanding of using Sequelize and front-end UI's was fortified. 

I am now more confident than ever in my abilities as a full-stack developer, and I am ready to apply these skills to any challenges I face in the future!
